# Introduction
Welcome to my first milestone project, The Art of Poi
Earlier this year I enrolled in a Full Stack Development course, with the hopes of changing my career and becoming a programmer. Up to this point in my career, I have worked in multiple sectors, of IT  and have always flirted around the side of coding but never really understood it properly
The purpose of this project is to show my learning and understanding of the modules and languages I have learned, to implement them into a project to showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, built mainly with HTML and CSS.
I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspiration, and my focus on user experience design.
Thank you for viewing my project and I hope you enjoy the project as much as I did designing and developing it.

## UX - User Experience Design
 Part of inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Steve Krug‚Äôs, ‚ÄúDon't make Me Think‚Äù. By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a positive one. For the user to have a positive emotional response throughout the project.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane
&nbsp;



## Strategy Plane
The goal as a creator of my project is to inform and encourage people to take up the art of poi spinning

**Creator stories**

Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want to make sure the project is easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want to to make sure users never feel lost in the text going through the page.
- As a creator, I want the project to invoke a positive emotional response from users, potentially relating to learning something new or expanding on current knowledge.
- As a creator, I want to make sure all content on the page is relatable, from images to text and quotes, and avoid elements from feeling random or out of place.
- As a creator I want to avoid users from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content, finding a way to structure content so users do not feel put off from the moment they land on a page.
Having established a strategy for what I would like for my users, the most important part was to start thinking from the perspective of the user and how a user would feel going through the project.
