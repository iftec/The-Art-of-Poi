            <h2>What is Poi?</h2>
            <p>Poi is both the name of the object (a weight on the end of a flexible cord) and what you do with that object (spin it in circles around your body). Sounds simple? It is! And its also super fun, affordable, and scientifically proven to help your brain and body feel amazing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is believed that poi originally came from the Māori of New Zealand. Today, poi continues to play an important role in Māoridom and across the globe as a form of performance, play, and fitness.
             </p> 
             <br>
             <p>  
                Common forms of Poi include  Spin Poi, Fire Poi,  Led Poi and Visual Poi.
                Visual Poi relies on Persistence of Vision (The optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye.)
            </p>

            <h3>Health Benifits</h3>
            <p>
                In 2018, the first scientific study in the world on the benefits of poi was conducted at the University of Auckland by Dr. Kate Riegle van West. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Seventy-nine healthy older adults participated in the double-blind randomized controlled trial. After one month of poi practice, there were statistically significant improvements in grip strength, balance, and sustained attention. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Poi has the perfect mix of physical and cognitive elements to keep your brain and body engaged. It's playful. It's rhythmic. It's challenging (yet achievable!)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Poi is known to improve gross motor skills and improve             coordination and body awarness though bilateral intergration and rhythmic movement.

            </p>
            <br>
             <p>
                To get started you can easily build your own poi from commonly found items. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You can use long socks with small bags of rice in the toes. Simply put a small amount of rice in the toe section and then tie a knot to keep the rice in place. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You can use tennis balls (or any other type of ball the same size), with lengths of cords knotted at each end. Simply make a small hole at each end of the ball and thread some cord through, tying a small knot to secure the ball.
            <p>
            <br>
                You can use the short glow sticks tied to lengths of cord. These of course have a limited life span, but look very effective in darkend environments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We suggest you don't use anything too heavy to start with, as accidental collisions may occur until you become more skilled.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the classes we show you several other ways to build these and provide discounts for several online suppliers of equipment.
