            <h2>What is Poi?</h2>
            <p>Poi is both the name of the object (a weight on the end of a flexible cord) and what you do with that object (spin it in circles around your body). Sounds simple? It is! And its also super fun, affordable, and scientifically proven to help your brain and body feel amazing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is believed that poi originally came from the Māori of New Zealand. Today, poi continues to play an important role in Māoridom and across the globe as a form of performance, play, and fitness.
             </p> 
             <br>
             <p>  
                Common forms of Poi include  Spin Poi, Fire Poi,  Led Poi and Visual Poi.
                Visual Poi relies on Persistence of Vision (The optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye.)

            <h3>Health Benifits</h3>
            <p>In 2018, the first scientific study in the world on the benefits of poi was conducted at the University of Auckland by Dr. Kate Riegle van West. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Seventy-nine healthy older adults participated in the double-blind randomized controlled trial. After one month of poi practice, there were statistically significant improvements in grip strength, balance, and sustained attention. </p>
